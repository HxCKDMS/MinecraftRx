A simple (currently only one class) mod that adds in (currently 7) unique potions based loosely on real-life pharmacy and pharmacognosy

<b> Please note this mod may not fully be family friendly as it contains mild refrences to illcit drugs! </b>

Currently only for 1.14

Mod quirks:
* Please note that when making these potions that as soon as they are finished brewing they need to be removed from the stand or they will brew loop and waste materials
* These potions cannot be modified by glowstone or any other potion modifying items (E.G gunpowder)

Potions added (current as of version one):

* Weak Morphine: Instant health I followed by nausea for ~22 seconds - Made from poppy 
* Sea Pickle Juice: Conduit power effect for 120 seconds and instant damage I upon drinking
* Vomiting mixture: Rapidly lowers food bar - Made from rotten flesh
* Muscimol: Nausea, Glowing, Blindness and Night Vision effects at the same time for 30 seconds - Makes for an interesting in-game "trip" - Made from red mushroom blocks
* Weak Psilocybin: Diffrent in-game "trip" - Nausea, Glowing and Night Vision at the same time for 60 seconds - Made from brown mushroom blocks
* Norzoanthamine: Haste II for 15 seconds and strength I for 15 seconds - made from blue tube coral
* Complanine: lingering poison potion - made from fire coral
* Cornflower Extract: Strength for 15 seconds nausea for ~22 seconds - made from cornflower
* Peony Extract: Instant health I followed by 20 seconds of slowness - made from peony 

Future plans:
* Add ability for mod to be translated
* Attempt to fix brew loop issue
* Add in more drugs
